# Kratin-Task
In this task I have made a responsive website with HTML, CSS and Javascript which shows the healthcare facilities for 65+ years old to live a healthy life and what to follow in daily routine.
This website is easy to handle and to know our services which helps them to get better facility.
I have added 5 navigation heads which follows: home, about, services, booking, and contacts.
In the service I have given overview of our basic service by where a person can look for his/her needs and after that they can book an appointment and also call us for the service.
In JavaScript, I have given a "strict" function for navigation and for booking for an appointment.
